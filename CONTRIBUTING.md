# Contributing to Household Harmony Hub

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Household Harmony Hub as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/household-harmony-hub/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/household-harmony-hub/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Code Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic
- Follow React best practices
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Test the app on both desktop and mobile
2. Verify offline functionality works
3. Check that data persists correctly
4. Test import/export features

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Open an issue on GitHub and label it as an enhancement. Provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Why you think it would be useful
- Any implementation ideas you have

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue with the "question" label if you have any questions about contributing.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
